The brains in this folder are provided for testing and development
efforts. Replacing them will likely break tests. As some tests
*output* you'll likely need to run the Regenerate.sh script while
developing to ensure that data outputs are unaffected.

To run the regenerate script you'll need to have the `libfaketime`
library. You might need to modify the path in the script to have the
correct path.
